                                                    <h4>Tools/Programs Used</h4>
                                                    <p>Bowler Studio was initially created by Kevin Harrington while he was an undergrad at WPI. Since then it has evolved into a fully functional robotics design platform. With it, students are able CAD robots with the use of code, as opposed to using a GUI editor. Using scripts instead of a GUI is incredibly helpful when programming because it allows students to make far more specific changes in the robot. For example, Bowler Studio has many basic operations to edit the robot, such as union, difference, and hull. Union combines two different objects together, difference subtracts one object from another, and hull bridges any gap between two objects. These operations allow for fine-tuned editing quickly and easily. Another one of the very useful functions is the use of Bezier curves. These curves take in three or more points, draws a straight line between the first and last points, and uses the middle ones to draw out the line into a smooth curve. This is useful for anything that requires a non-straight line.</P>
													<p>Bowler Studio is fully integrated with GitHub, so all of the work that a student does is backed up and saved online. This way, multiple students can work in conjunction with relative ease. Additionally, this application has a tool that allows a student to control the robot in Bowler Studio, and have it update in real life. If the digital and physical robot do not match up, then the students can work through the problems far easier.</p>
													<p>Most of the scripts used to work on this project were written in the groovy programming language. Groovy is similar to Java; it is typed. This means that every variable must be assigned a type before it is declared and int variables cannot contain strings. Groovy also contains a lot of features that allow code to compile through errors. For example, if one forgets to write a return statement inside of a method, Groovy tries to figure out what might be the desired return variable in the loop and tries to return that. This is helpful because if there are some errors in the code, it will still compile and show the rest of the project even if there is an error in part of the code. Groovy is also very similar to Java with nearly identical syntax, so transitioning from Java to Groovy was fairly seamless.</p>
													<p>All of the separate parts of the dog were connected by linking GitHub scripts worked on by each individual into one XML file. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. The XML file in this project pulls every modeling script together to build the dog. The XML file has linked drive and CAD engines that each student can work on independently and put into one unifying file. The XML file contains not only the scripts, but also additional information about the size and orientation of different parts of the model. This is where information such as D-H parameters and link hardware settings are held (see later for details on these types of data).</p>
													<p>After making a change to the code, one can publish to GitHub through the use of detailed commits. Students use descriptive commit messages to convey exactly what they changed in the code, so that team members can quickly understand what many changes did. Additionally, each commit is able to be reverted, so if it turns out that a change broke the code, then the students can track down exactly which commit they need to revert by reading the detailed messages.</p>
													<p>Another one of GitHub's features is branch management and forking. After someone has created a file or project, other people can then create a new branch and fork it to their own account. This means that they have copied the entire project to their own account, so they can make changes without affecting the master branch. When they believe their changes are finished, they can then submit a pull request and merge their version of the project back into the master branch.</p>

                                                    <p>D-H parameters are Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. They are a way of attaching a reference frame between links of a robot. In non-technical terms, it is how the links know how to orient themselves based on the previous links position and these parameters. (greek letter) R is the distance along the rotated x axis, or the radius of rotation about the original z axis. Alpha rotates the old z axis into the new z axis orientation. D is the depth along the original joints z axis to the plane of the new one. Theta is the angle that lines up the original x axis with the new x axis.</p>

                                                    <h4>Design/Build Process</h4>
                                                    <p>To size out bulldog model, an English Bulldog measurements were taken during a class period. Below, See our marked up picture with dimensions written in. We used the measurements to calculate our DH parameter R, which is the length of a link. Head measurements were used to scale the existing head model.</p>
													<p>Once each individual part of the bulldog was modeled, an XML (Extensible Markup Language) was used to create the complete creature. In the XML file, all of the attributes of the bulldog were defined, such as how many legs it had, what size each joint was, and what types of servo motors were being used to move the joints. Additionally, the positions of every leg were defined and the D-H parameters for each joint were set; this allowed Bowler Studio to place each servo in the correct position.</p>
													<p>In the XML file, the CAD generation scripts for each part of the dog were linked together so that Bowler Studio would generate everything together in their proper positions. After doing this, a full model of the skeleton of the dog was generated, with the head, body, neck, and legs all pieced together. Finally, the physics and walking engines were set in the XML, which Bowler Studio uses to simulate the walking of the robot.</p>
													<p>The bowler studio interface was an integral part of movement scripting. First, an Arduino Teensy was connected. Next, the script generated a CAD of the robotic dog. The robotic dog normally has a separate window used to control its motion for the purpose of modeling, but when a teensy is connected, the physical model moves along with the CAD model. This was important for setting up link zeroes (the starting positions) and the limits (how far forward and back) that we wanted the leg to stay within.</p>
													<p>Also, connecting a Teensy was used to determine the Scale To Degrees Value, a value that allows bowler studio to see how much one servo unit matches up to a degree in the physical world. The scale to degrees value was obtained by first making a leg parallel to the ground and noting the servo value at that position. Next, using the DyiO window on Bowler Studio that appears when a teensy was connected, the servo value vas manually edited until the link was perpendicular to the ground. The difference in servo values divided by 90 (the degree change associated with this movement) is how the scale to degrees was obtained. The Scale To Degrees value is equal and opposite on the right side of the robot because all servos are positioned facing away from the center of the robot, and so one side has to be flipped from the other.</p>
													<p>To determine link zeroes, links were placed on a table and their servo values were changed until the link was perpendicular with the ground.</p>
													<p>To determine link limits one link was tested for approximate angles of a bulldogs legs. The differences from the center (zero) of that link were recorded and then added onto the other unique links. For example, the zero of the test leg was 83, with top limit 255 and bottom limit 0, so all of the bottom limits are 83 units less than the zero and 172 more than the zero.</p>
													<p>The robotic dog requires 16 servos to be run simultaneously, and each teensy only supports 12 servo connections, so two Teensies were connected to run the dog when it was completed. One teensy was connected to all of the more powerful servos for the legs of the robot while the second was used exclusively for the head and neck servos. To connect a second teensy, another teensy was connected through the connect a device, connect a bowler device with connection dialog button. To change which teensy each servo is connected to, there is an option called device scripting name inside of the hardware configuration menus of bowler studio. When connecting another device, another device name (dyio1) was generated and the other servos were connected just like the first.</p>
													<p>To run, a servo requires power and a control signal. A servo has a middle wire for power and one of the outside wires (the darker outside in most cases, brown in our case) is ground. The other outside wire (the lighter outside in most cases, orange in our case) is connected to port 0-12 on the teensy and transports the commands of the teensy. Below picture of the soldered board. The Teensy on the left controls the eyes, the neck, and the tail, and the teensy on the right controls all of the leg servo's. Also pictured is a VEX battery connector soldered onto the far side of the board for 7.2V power. The eyes, jaw, and tail were wired to the other side of the board for power because the servos require lower voltage power to run. The wires were labeled with yellow electrical tape for organizational purposes.</p>
													<p>The Teensies had header pins soldered onto them, and they were then soldered onto a standard Arduino proto-board. They were arranged to face the same direction to allow a USB cable to run from the dog to a computer running a simulation of the walking process.</p>

                                                    <h4>Head/Neck</h4>
                                                    <p>The base design of the robotic head was derived from Kevin Harrington's robotic head code. This particular design allows for control of the jaw and eyes through the use of servo motors. There are a total of three motors on the robot. One for the jaw movements, and two for the eyes. In order to get both eyes working with only two motors, the motors were configured to control one of the axes each, but for both eyes at the same time. Additionally, the head is programmed to be parametric, so anyone can change the dimensions of the head incredibly easily. This was very helpful in the construction of the robotic head, as it allowed the creation of a head that was proportionally similar to a real bulldog.</p>
													<p>When the robotic head was forked over, it was then configured with the specifications and design of a real bulldog. Namely, the top of the head and the front of the face were flattened. After all of the measurements were translated to the digital head, a prototype was printed. However, many of the pieces did not fit together due to the printer nozzle having a range of error. As a solution, the three base plates of the head (jaw, base plate, and eye plate) had a Minkowski operation applied to it. This operation took in a cube that is the size of the printer nozzle, and subtracted that size from all of the vertices of the holes. This corrected for the error of the nozzle, allowing the pieces to fit together properly.</p>
													<p>The neck design is a very basic one. It is simply a rectangular block with four screw holes and a servo cutout. The block slides over the servo, fitting onto VEX C-Channel. The attachment method from the neck to the head utilized hot glue, wire, and C-Channel. First, a servo horn was placed underneath C-Channel, with wire holding it temporarily in place. Then hot glue was applied generously surrounding the servo horn and C-Channel. The horn and C-Channel were screwed into the servo itself. The next step was to create holes in the head to allow the C-Channel to be screwed in. Using a drill, three attachment points were created in the head. Finally, three screws were screwed through the C-Channel and the head.</p>

                                                    <h4>Body</h4>
                                                    <p>The body was designed around a core utilizing two C-Channels from VEX robotics. This provided support for the rest of the body, and minimizes the required amount of 3D printed material. Metal is stronger than 3D material, is more versatile in terms of attachment points, and does not need to be reprinted if something goes wrong. Additionally, 3D printed ribs were designed to aid with the soft modeling process. They are simple arcs with attachment points for the c-channel, to give a base shape to the foam and body of the bulldog.</p>
													<p>The attachment points for the legs are on two smaller c-channels perpendicular to the main body, to spread them to the right width from the core. 3D printed parts were modeled to have a flat surface with holes to be bolted onto the C-Channels, and a hold point for the servo used to turn the legs side to side. This structure was pulled from the leg links, as described below, for the sake of consistency and a more dynamic workflow in the case of changes. Caps were then added to the shoulder links to keep the servos in place when under stress, and to correctly align the servo horns and connectors.</p>
													<p>Because bulldog tails are not very long, the tail was designed to simply push some of the soft foam used to model the back out and have the ability to wag. The tail servo horn is not long enough to accomplish this task, so a small 3D printed extension was designed for the tail.</p>

                                                    <h4>Legs</h4>
                                                    <p>Leg design was approached with the plan of first creating a function for creating a "leg link", then calling that function multiple times per leg.</p>
													<p>The first step involved designing the "leg link" (LL). The goal was to create a study link that could snugly hold the HV6214MG servos while also being able to be easily connected to other LLs. As seen in the first leg link picture below, the base LL is a rectangular block with rounded edges. In the center is a complete servo cutout, and two screw holes are built in as well to secure the servo.</p>
													<p>Also, in order to connected different base linked to each other, "connector" pieces were made to click in on one end to the back of an LL and on the other end to the rotating knob of the servo that is in a LL. See connector picture under leg pictures. In order to secure the connectors onto the LLs, special caps were made that are able to clip onto the outsides of an LL and keep the connector in place but still allow for rotation. See the cap picture under leg pictures.</p>
													<p>Once the LL, connector, and cap STLs were complete, the were pulled into the XML scripting file to create full legs (see combination of LL, connector, and cap in a pic below). Each leg is made out of two base links, a special "foot" STL (which is just a connector with a sphere at the end, see picture below), and a special "shoulder" link at the top. The shoulder link is just a normal LL with an additional triangular shape built around it in order to secure it to the body. The length of each LL was taken from the physical measurements of the bulldog we took and is inputted as a parameter to the LL method upon LL creation. See picture below for a full leg attached to the c-channel body.</p>

                            <p>A Computer Science and Astrophysics double major at Colby College, Andrew was responsible for designing and building J.E.B.'s head. He adpated an existing animatronic head design and adapted it to the proportions needed to not only fit J.E.B.'s frame but also make it appear more dog like. Andrew also designed a neck structure that supported the weight of the head and gave it the ability to turn.</p>

                            <p>Muhammad, a Computer Science major at Carnegie Mellon University, was responsible for bringing together all of the design scripts to form a complete model of J.E.B. in Bowler Studio. He also used the measurements taken of Roz the bulldog to ensure each part printed for J.E.B. was correctly sized to make J.E.B. the size and shape of a real English bulldog.\n</p>

                            <p>This project could'nt have been completed without the help and tutelage of our teachers, who not only helped us understand the technical concepts that enabled us to create J.E.B. but also provided us with the resources and materials we needed along the way. Special thanks to Bancroft School's Elisa Heinricher and Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Kevin Harringotn for making the project possible.\n</p>
